A dynamic and interactive flip card component built using React, SCSS, CSS, and JavaScript. This project demonstrates the use of Sass for easy color customization, allowing you to modify the design just by changing a few variables in the Sass file.

## Features

- **Flip Animation**: Smooth and interactive flip animation using CSS transitions.
- **Easy Color Customization**: The color scheme is controlled through a Sass file, making it easy to change the card's appearance by updating variables.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Built with Modern Technologies**: Uses React for the component structure, SCSS for styling, and JavaScript for interaction.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **SCSS (Sass)**: Preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into CSS, offering variables and nesting for organized styling.
